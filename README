todolist
========

A TUI application in order to keep track of todo-list items, and it runs in the
terminal. Still in a beta-like status, some features are absent (notably,
editing items after the fact, and deleting items). It was originally made for
my own purposes in school, so it uses school-like vocabulary (i.e. assignments,
classes, etc)

The new assignment box takes the date in the YYYY-MM-DD format and the date in
a HH:MM format (24 hour time).
